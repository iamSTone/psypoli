    "    - What are the sources of ideological constraint—the forces that collapse or “map” the complex issue space onto the low-dimensional basic space? \n",
    "    - As Jost, Federico and Napier (2009) discuss in a recent review essay, psychologists and political scientists often differ on the process by which policy preferences are bundled together.\n",
    "        - Political scientists tend to emphasize the role of political elites—parties, interest groups, and elected officials—in packaging a comprehensive set of issue positions into an ideological whole.\n",
    "            - The fact that what constitutes the conservative or liberal position on a given issue can change (sometimes dramatically, as in the case of abortion in the 1970s [Stimson, 2004, pp. 57–60]) illustrates the importance of elite political actors in the mapping process.\n",
    "        - Conversely, psychologists tend to view ideological structure as stemming from a variety of personality traits, needs, motives, and atti- tudes (Jost, Federico and Napier, 2009).\n",
    "            - For example, openness to change has a leftward influence, while preferences for order and structure exert a rightward effect."
